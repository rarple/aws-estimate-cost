# aws-estimate-cost
Wrapper around AWS CLI to allow estimation of a cloud formation template. This is a perl wrapper to "aws cloudformation estimate-template-cost", mostly cause the normal CLI usage is a little clumsy.

# Requirements
* The AWS CLI installed and configured
* Perl

This script has only been tested on Linux systems.

#TODO
Need to handle the case(s) where %parsed does not contain all three keys
